# Extraction-of-information-from-Medicine
Visually impaired people are more likely to be fooled by shrewd chemists. No one focuses on this problem but it exists in our society. To stop people from getting cheated, our vision is to design a tool that can update the off-the-shelf inventory by just scanning the images of medicines The proposed solution is used to extract some basic but important details from that package of medicine like name of that medicine, manufacturing date, expiry date, MRP(maximum retail price) of that medicine and convert  them to speech format.
###
### We propose a model to detect and recognize the text from the images and convert them into speech using a deep learning framework.
